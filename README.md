# lab-dsp
My twist on all of the exercises proposed in the laboratory phase of the course of Distributed and Pervasive Systems at Universit√° degli studi di Milano, kept by professors Ardagna and Bettini.<br>
The code can be downloaded through the release or through a clone of the repository, since the exercises tend to change every year this should be used as a guideline to understand what the course is about and what kind of level the student is expected to reach by the end of the course. To understand even better there is the complete code of my project in a repository that is still under embargo due to the fact that the project lasts one year.<br>
<!-- <a href="https://github.com/S3gmentati0nFault/Greenfield">here</a> -->
In this repository you can find:
  - An exercise about messaging systems using sockets
  - Concurrency / concurrent accesses to servers in C-S architectures
  - GRPC
  - HTTP and REST
  - MQTT

## To-do:
  - [ ] Complete the documentation for the project
  - [ ] Add a Group class to simulate a group-chat in the ChatGPT exercise
